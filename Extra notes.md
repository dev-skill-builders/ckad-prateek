Tips to note before starting,

- There are no time limit for one single question. 

- You can go back and forth on questions.

- You DONOT need to memorise resource yaml formats, infact in the actual exam console they allow you to open another tab where we are allowed to access anything under https://kubernetes.io/docs. Copy paste is also allowed.

- Once you go through the below course, bookmark the useful links. Those can be used directly in the exam. That way you will save time finding what you need from https://kubernetes.io/docs.
